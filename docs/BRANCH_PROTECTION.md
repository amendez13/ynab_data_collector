# Branch Protection Configuration

This document describes the branch protection rules configured for the `main` branch to ensure code quality and prevent accidental or harmful changes.

## Prerequisites

### Repository Visibility Requirements

**Important:** Branch protection rules have different requirements based on repository visibility:

| Repository Type | Branch Protection | Requirements |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Public** | ✓ Free | No additional requirements |
| **Private** | ✓ Requires GitHub Pro | Must upgrade to GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise |

**Current Repository Status:**
- **Repository:** Check with `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`
- **Visibility:** [To be determined during setup]
- **Branch Protection:** [To be configured]

> **Note:** If you want to keep your repository private and use branch protection, you'll need GitHub Pro or higher. Alternatively, you can make the repository public to use branch protection for free. Without branch protection enforcement, CI will still run on all pushes and PRs, but merging won't be blocked if checks fail.

## Quick Start

**To apply branch protection, choose one option:**

### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/github/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

### Option B: GitHub CLI One-Liner
```bash
# Replace <owner>/<repo> with your repository (or use: gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api -X PUT /repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection \
  --input scripts/github/branch-protection-config.json
```

### Option C: Manual Setup
See [Manual Configuration via GitHub UI](#option-2-manual-configuration-via-github-ui) below.

## Overview

Branch protection rules help maintain code quality by requiring specific checks to pass before code can be merged into the `main` branch. This ensures that all changes are reviewed, tested, and meet quality standards.

## Protection Rules for `main` Branch

### Required Status Checks

All CI checks must pass before merging:

**Strict Status Checks:**
- `Lint and Code Quality` - Code formatting, linting, and type checking
- `Test Python 3.12` - Tests on Python 3.12
- `CI Status Check` - Final CI status verification

**Non-blocking Checks:**
- `Security Checks` - Security scans (warnings allowed)
- `Integration Tests` - Integration tests (when enabled)

**Configuration:**
- **Require branches to be up to date before merging**: Enabled
  - This ensures that PRs are tested against the latest `main` before merging
  - Prevents "green build, broken main" scenarios

### Pull Request Requirements

**Require Pull Request Reviews:**
- Disabled for solo development
  - GitHub doesn't allow PR authors to approve their own PRs
  - For solo developers: Protection still ensures CI passes and conversations are resolved
  - Can be enabled when working with a team by setting `required_approving_review_count`

**Note for Solo Developers:**
- While PR approval is disabled, you still benefit from:
  - Required status checks (all CI must pass)
  - Conversation resolution requirement
  - Linear history enforcement
  - Protection against accidental force pushes/deletions

### Additional Protections

| Setting | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Require linear history | Enabled | Prevents merge commits, keeps history clean |
| Allow force pushes | Disabled | Prevents accidentally overwriting history |
| Allow deletions | Disabled | Prevents accidental branch deletion |
| Require conversation resolution | Enabled | All comments must be resolved |
| Include administrators | Enabled | Admins must also follow rules |

## Implementation

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

Run this command to apply the branch protection configuration:

```bash
# Replace <owner>/<repo> with your repository (or use: gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api -X PUT /repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection \
  --input scripts/github/branch-protection-config.json
```

The configuration file is located at `scripts/github/branch-protection-config.json`.

**Note:** The automated script (`./scripts/github/setup-branch-protection.sh`) already has the correct repository path configured.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration via GitHub UI

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click **Add rule**
4. Enter branch name pattern: `main`
5. Configure the following settings:

**Protect matching branches:**
- [ ] Require a pull request before merging (optional for solo dev)
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Add these status checks:
    - `Lint and Code Quality`
    - `Test Python 3.12`
    - `CI Status Check`
- [x] Require conversation resolution before merging
- [x] Require linear history
- [x] Include administrators

6. Click **Create** or **Save changes**

## Verifying Branch Protection

After applying branch protection, verify it's working correctly:

### Check via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Check if branch protection is enabled (replace <owner>/<repo> with your repository)
gh api /repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'

# Expected output:
# [
#   "Lint and Code Quality",
#   "Test Python 3.12",
#   "CI Status Check"
# ]
```

### Check via GitHub UI

Visit your repository's branch settings at: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/branches`

You should see a protection rule for the `main` branch with all configured settings.

### Test with a Pull Request

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b test/branch-protection`
2. Make a small change and commit it
3. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin test/branch-protection`
4. Create a PR on GitHub
5. Verify that:
   - CI checks run automatically
   - Merge button is blocked until checks pass
   - You cannot force push to `main`

## Working with Branch Protection

### For Pull Requests

When you create a pull request:

1. **CI checks will run automatically**
   - All required checks must pass
   - Fix any failures before merging

2. **Merge when ready**
   - All checks must be green
   - All conversations resolved
   - Branch is up to date with `main`

### Merge Strategies

**Recommended: Squash and Merge**
- Combines all PR commits into a single commit
- Keeps `main` history clean and readable

**Alternative: Rebase and Merge**
- Replays PR commits on top of `main`
- Maintains individual commit history

**Not Recommended: Merge Commit**
- Disabled by "Require linear history" setting

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If your PR conflicts with `main`:

```bash
git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature"

**Error:**
```
{"message":"Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature.","status":"403"}
```

**Cause:** Branch protection on private repositories requires GitHub Pro or higher.

**Solutions:**

1. **Make repository public (Free):**
   ```bash
   # Replace <owner>/<repo> with your repository
   gh repo edit <owner>/<repo> --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences
   ```

2. **Upgrade to GitHub Pro:**
   - Visit GitHub Settings → Billing
   - Subscribe to GitHub Pro ($4/month as of 2024)
   - Includes branch protection for unlimited private repos

3. **Work without branch protection enforcement:**
   - CI will still run on all pushes and PRs
   - You'll need to manually verify CI passes before merging
   - Use discipline to avoid force pushes and direct commits to main

### "Required status check is expected but not reported"

**Cause:** The status check name doesn't match the job name in CI.

**Solution:**
1. Check the exact status check name in a recent PR
2. Update branch protection to use the exact name

### Can't merge even though CI passes

**Possible causes:**
1. Unresolved conversations → Resolve all comments
2. Branch not up to date → Rebase on `main`
3. Status check name mismatch → Check exact names

## Security Considerations

**What branch protection protects against:**
- Accidental pushes to `main`
- Merging broken code
- Force pushing over history
- Deleting the main branch

**Additional security measures:**
- Enable GitHub's secret scanning
- Use signed commits for critical changes
- Regularly rotate access tokens and secrets

## Best Practices

1. **Always work in feature branches**
   - Never commit directly to `main`
   - Use descriptive branch names: `feature/add-dark-mode`, `fix/auth-bug`

2. **Keep PRs focused and small**
   - Easier to review
   - Faster to merge
   - Less likely to conflict

3. **Keep your branch up to date**
   - Regularly rebase on `main`
   - Avoid long-lived feature branches
